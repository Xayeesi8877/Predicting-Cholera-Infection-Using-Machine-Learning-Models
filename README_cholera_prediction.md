# Predicting Cholera Infection Using Machine Learning Models Based on Clinical and Demographic Data: A Retrospective Study

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning study aimed at predicting cholera infection using clinical and demographic features. The project applies various supervised learning algorithms to analyze retrospective data and evaluate their predictive performance.

---

## 🚀 **Project Goals**
- Build predictive models to identify cholera cases based on clinical symptoms and demographic characteristics.
- Compare performance of different machine learning algorithms.
- Provide interpretable results that can support healthcare decision-making.

---

## 📝 **Key Features**
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.
- Models implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and potentially other classifiers.
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Visualizations of model performance and feature importance.
